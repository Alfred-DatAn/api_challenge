# api_challenge

The api_challenge contains two sub-projects: 

__WeatherPy__. Which performs a weather analysis over 500+ cities around the world to identify trends and correlations.

__VacationPy__. The cities from the previous sub-project were filtered to certain weather conditions to find those with ideal weather. Then find the nearest hotel in each one of those cities and display them in a world map.

Thanks!
